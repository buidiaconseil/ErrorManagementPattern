Error Management Pattern

# Principal Strategies

- Ignore Error: This unlikely strategy can often be the most effective: do nothing in case of errors
- Isolate Error: ignore the error in the context of the current conversation, but handle all errors afterwards.
- Retry: if you don't succeed at first, try again
- Retry with a delay : if you don't succeed at first, try again
